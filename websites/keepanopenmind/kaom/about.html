<b>So, you want to know more about us then eh?</b><br/><br/>There isn't too much to know about KeepAnOpenMind, but we will try and keep this filled with some information that may be useful to you, such as where <b>TomAldy</b> came up with the idea.<br/><br/>Well, we will begin with a simple explanation of how the whole idea of KeepAnOpenMind began...<br/><br/><br/<br/><br/><br/><b>KeepAnOpenMind</b> started as a fansite called 'EpicHabbo.net' which was opened back in 2008, same layout, more or less the same content, along with the same owner. The fansite failed to due a number of reasons...
<ul>
<li>Habbo became less appealing to <b>TomAldy</b>.</li>
<li>There was not enough staff to support the fansite.</li>
<li>The expense of running a fansite was too much for <b>TomAldy</b> at such a young age.</li>
</ul>
As <b>TomAldy</b> stopped playing Habbo, he forgot how interesting it can be for meeting new people and sharing interests, so he thought he would try a different approach as he returned to the world of Habbo, he found <b><a href="http://www.openhabbo.com" target="_blank">openHabbo</a></b> and joined the <b><a href="http://www.vibearray.com" target="_blank">vibeArray</a></b> community.<br/><br/>
So there you have it, there is currently not much history to KeepAnOpenMind, but we are sure that'll change as the website grows and gains more popularity; we already have <b>A LOT</b> of plans for the future!<br/><br/><i><b>Look below for the current version of KeepAnOpenMind...</b></i><br/><br/><br/>
