<b>So, I bet you're wondering what the radio is all about?</b><br/><br/>Of course we've already explained who the radio is ran by.. but what else could there be to say? Well, we need to explain to you that currently there is <b>no request line</b> this is due to openHabbo radio being such a new feature of the openHabbo hotel, there has currently been no DJ Panel set up. We have set up a request line that <b>DOES NOT WORK</b> this is just to create the feeling of a real request line for all you regular listeners!<br/><br/> The best chance of getting your song played on the radio is by talking to the DJ currently on air!<br/><br/>

So you always know who is in and who is out of the radio team etc!<br/><br/>
