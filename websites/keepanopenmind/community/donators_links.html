<img src="../images/Gift_sleeper.gif" align="left" />We believe that every person who donates to <b>KeepAnOpenMind</b> deserves to have a mention once in a while, whether it even be for one of the staff winning a competition from another fansite or even on the official openHabbo events, we like to include this as a kind little donation towards the website itself!<br/><br/>But, do not feel as if you have to donate, that is not how we wish to make you feel; donate if you are willing too and feel you have furniture you want to part with, if that is your wish; once your furniture has been donated, we can't promise we will be able to give it back to you!
