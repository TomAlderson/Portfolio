<img src="../images/MPokora_FIN_habbo_kuvitus.gif" align="right" />There are many movies every day that are submitted to the <b>HabboWood Movie Maker</b> that we use to allow our users to create movies! BUT, the main thing people care about is being the best, we can't lie about that! The whole HabboWood section of the website is mainly based on competition, hence the top 20 situated in the bottom right hand corner of the page! ;)<br/><br/>Remember, just because you didn't make it this week does not mean you won't next week! There are plenty of people able to create movies, the more effort put into the movie, the bigger the reward!
