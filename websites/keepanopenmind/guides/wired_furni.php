<b>Wired Furni is a very simple thing to achieve...</b><br/>
<i>Now.. where do I begin?</i><br/><br/>
Wired Furni has been a great addition to the openHabbo Hotel, without it there would be a very difficult way of directing people where you want to go in rooms, the most popular rooms that Wired Furni is used for has to be Mazes, they use Wired Furni to move around furni and ask questions to the contestant trying to complete the maze.<br/><br/>
Wired Furni has given plenty of people the option to make special effects within their room! You are allowed ot use it for hundreds of reasons, the possiblities are endless, but the best effect of them all is the ability to make any openHabbo User enter a room at a specific part of the room, this helps people a lot with there rooms because they are able to create a real wallpaper, allowing the peoplew who enter the room not to get stuck in the corridor that leads onto the room!<br/><br/>
<i>Enough of the bragging, let's begin!</i><br/><br/>
<b>Triggers</b><br/>
<i>Now of course you know all of the pieces of wired trigger furni available.. No? Well, here they are...</i><br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/at_set_time.png" title="Effects are triggered at a given time after the timer is reset." title="Effects are triggered at a given time after the timer is reset." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/furni_state.png" title="Effects are triggered when the state of a Furni is changed by clicking it." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/game_ends.png" title="Effects are triggered when a game end in the room." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/game_starts.png" title="Effects are triggered when a game starts in the room." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/repeat_effect.png" title="Effects are triggered every x seconds." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/score_achieved.png" title="Effects are triggered when a team has achieved X points in a game." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/user_enters.png" title="Effects are triggered when a user enters the room." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/user_says.png" title="Effects are triggered when a user says a certain word or phrase." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/user_walks_off_furni.png" title="Effects are triggered when an avatar walks off a furni." /><img src="../images/guides/wired/triggers/user_walks_on_furni.png" title="Effects are triggered when an avatar walks on a furni." />
</center><br/><br/>Triggers are used to decide when exactly the wired furni will activate, as you can see they are all different, if you hover over each one, there will be a box that explains what exactly each one does!<br/><br/>
<b>Effects</b><br/>
<i>Oh and who can forget the Effects part of the furni!? Here they are...</i><br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/give_points.png" title="This Effect gives the set amount of points to the team that triggers the effect." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/matched_furni.png" title="This Effect returns the selected Furni to its set conditions." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/move_and_rotate.png" title="This Effect moves and rotates the selected furni." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/show_message.png" title="This Effect shows a secret message only to the triggering users." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/teleport_to_furni.png" title="This Effect teleports the triggering user to a Furni. If you select more than one Furni the user triggering the Effect will be teleported to any random Furni selected for the Effect." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/time_reset.png" title="This Effect resets triggers that use timers." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/effects/toggle_furni.png" title="This Effect changes the state of the chosen Furni as if the Furni has just been double clicked." />
</center>
<br/><br/>
Effects are added to triggers so you can decide what happens when a trigger is activated! There are a number of six Effects you can choose from!<br/><br/>
<b>Conditions</b><br/>
<i>Let's be a little fussy with our Wired Furni!</i><br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="../images/guides/wired/conditions/furni_has_been_walked_on.png" title="Triggering is allowed if all the selected Furni have users on them." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/conditions/furni_state.png" title="Triggering is allowed if the states and positions of the selected Furni match."/>
<img src="../images/guides/wired/conditions/less_than.png" title="Triggering is allowed if less than x seconds have elapsed since timer reset." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/conditions/more_than.png" title="Triggering is allowed if more than x seconds have elapsed since timer reset." />
<img src="../images/guides/wired/conditions/triggering.png" title="Triggering is allowed if the triggering user is on one of the selected Furni." />
</center><br/><br/>
Conditions can be used to help you run games and especially make your Wired Furniture more accurate in the Effects that occur!<br/><br/>
<b>Add-Ons</b><br/>
<i>These are the add-ons you can use with your Wired Furni...</i><br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="../images/guides/wired/add-ons/table.png" />
</center>
<br/><br/>
All of the add-ons are usually just for decoration, the main ones to use are switches, but due to the Effects triggering everything, it is rare that anyone really uses switches!<br/><br/>
