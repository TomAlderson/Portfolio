There are not a lot of ways of adding a friend on openHabbo, simply because to be a friend with someone, you have to be in the same room as them, or you need to know their openHabbo Username to visit their openHabbo homepage!<br/><br/>The reason that there aren't that many methods of adding friends is because the Administrators do not want you making friends with the wrong kind of people, or to make friends with someone unless you know them first!<br/><br/>
Before we begin the guide you must know that...<br/><br/>
<i>You <b>MUST NOT</b> add anyone you do not know, if anyone wants to add you who has been having suspicious conversations with you, then report them immediately!</i><br/><br/><br/>

<i>Everyone knows this one...</i><br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Everyone knows this way, you simply click on a Habbo in the room and choose to send them a friend request, we have highlighted what exactly you need to click on the image above, although most people feel it's pretty simple- it's always nice to know how exactly you do specific things!<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Method Two</b><br/>
<i>Searching for friends!</i><br/><br/>

As you can see, there is another way of adding friends other than seeing them around the hotel! You can search for your friends in particular, of course you're going to meet people outisde of the hotel who play on the inside, this way- if they tell you their username you can freind request them ASAP!<br/><br/><br/>
