There are  a lot of alt codes within openHabbo that can be used in order to express the way you feel! There are of course a lot of effects to do this for you, but most Habbo's within openHabbo feel that they need to express themselves using speech rather than the way you look! <br/><br/>Plus, let's be honest, it's just another feature that we all love to play around with!<br/>None of us can resist a little play with a feature we've never seen before, even if it's been around since the dawn of openHabbo time, we can't help playing with it!<br/><br/>Alt Codes are simple, they're small little symbols displayed within the openHabbo speech bubbles, they're are quite a few of them, and we are here to explain how to do them and what each one means!<br/><br/><br/>
<b>All of the Alt Codes</b><br/>
<i>We told you there are a few...</i><br/><br/>
<center><img src="../images/alt_codes.gif" /></center><br/><br/>
Each one of them has a specific meaning, all you have to do is look at each one to know what they mean! There are a lot, and I bet you're wondering how to use them? Well, we will explain...<br/><br/>
If you're <b>using a computer</b> simply hold down the alt key and then enter the numbers needed to produce your chosen alt code. However, if you're using a laptop you'll have to to press the <b>FN key and the F11 key</b> before you begin, using the keys <b>"MJKLUIO789"</b> as your numbers, those of which will be shown above the selected key.
